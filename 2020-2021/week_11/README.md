# Week 11 - Privilege Escalation

This week we'll be looking into what privilege escalation is, what it involves, and some tools to do it with.

We also have some challenges below to try out privilege escalation on some boxes.

To begin any of these given you must be able to remotely access each box using a foothold. 
This will be done through SSH and is not part of the challenge this week, so we will give you the credentials...


From a terminal on your own PC or VM, use ``` ssh jeremy@<box_IP_address> ```. Each challenge specific box IP address can be found at the start of each challenge page.

'jeremy' is the user account accessed. Our dear friend Jeremy's SSH password is ```jeremy420``` - enter this when prompted and don't let him know we told you.
