# Week 7 - Juice Shop and SQL
In this weeks session we will be looking at hacking web applications using Burp Suite to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
To do this we'll be using your Kali VMs which should already have Burp Suite installed by default, and our web application target will be OWASP's Juice Shop.

If you haven't got Burp and Juice Shop set up from last week, follow through steps 1 & 2 as necessary to get setup for the challenges:

1. [How to deploy Juice Shop](https://github.com/DMUHackers/weekly_sessions/tree/master/2020-2021/week_6/deploy_juice_shop)
2. [How to configure Burp](https://github.com/DMUHackers/weekly_sessions/tree/master/2020-2021/week_6/burp_configuration)

Have a go at the challenges below! If you get stuck or just don't know how, try a bit of google-fu, or look through our handy hints and spoilers for a walkthrough:

 - Challenge 1 - [Log in as an admin](https://github.com/DMUHackers/weekly_sessions/tree/master/2020-2021/week_7/challenge_1)
