# Challenge 4 - A rathew cewl pizza party

We've arrested Max for doing something awful but he won't co-operate with us. We've seized his Windows 7 laptop and we believe knowing the password to his account will help with the investigation. We did some digging and found the [SAM](https://github.com/DMUHackers/weekly_sessions/raw/master/2020-2021/week_1/challenge_4/SAM) and [SYSTEM](https://github.com/DMUHackers/weekly_sessions/raw/master/2020-2021/week_1/challenge_4/SYSTEM) files on his machine. Can you find his password?

P.S. He won't stop talking about his [blog](https://max-pizza-party.tumblr.com/), we think it could provide some useful info

There is a [walkthrough](https://github.com/DMUHackers/weekly_sessions/blob/master/2020-2021/week_1/challenge_4/SPOILER_walkthrough.md) if you are struggling, but try your best without it first
