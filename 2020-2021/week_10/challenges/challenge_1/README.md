  Data is hidden in this image using `steghide`
  First, let's install it
  ```
  # apt update
  # apt install steghide
  ```

  Now let's extract the hidden file
  ```
  # steghide extract -sf bojack.jpg
  ```

  steghide asks for a passphrase, hitting enter we can try without using a passphrase
  ```
  Enter passphrase:
  wrote extracted data to "extracted_secret.txt".
  ```

  It worked! Now let's see what's hidden in the file
  ```
  # cat extracted_secret.txt
  ```
