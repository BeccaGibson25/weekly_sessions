# Burp Suite Configuration Guide

Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an applicationâ€™s attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. - [kali.org](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/burpsuite)

## 1 - FoxyProxy

To allow you to switch between browsing normally and using Burp Suite, it's best to install FoxyProxy. This enables you to quickly switch the proxy you are using.

### Installing FoxyProxy

First, go to the firefox add-ons page and install FoxyProxy.
